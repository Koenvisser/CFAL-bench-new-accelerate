# NAS Parallel Benchmark MG Kernel in APL

## Running the benchmark

To run the benchmark using Dyalog APL, make sure you are in the current working
directory that contains the MG.apln file. 

Linux:

	$ LOAD=.\MG.apln dyalog

Windows:

	$ dyalog.exe LOAD=.\MG.apln
	
For Windows, you can also create a shortcut file that contains the above 
command as long as you ensure that the working directory is set appropriately. 

You can also examine the `RUN.bat` or `RUN.sh` files.
