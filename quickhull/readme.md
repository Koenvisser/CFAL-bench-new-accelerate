# Quickhull

Quickhull is a divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of points. The divide-and-conquer recursion can be flattened, to allow efficient execution on GPUs. This is presented for instance presented in [Fast Two Dimensional Convex Hull on the GPU](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~kkishore/ainaHull.pdf) (Algorithm 2).
