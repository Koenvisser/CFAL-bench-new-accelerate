# ClickBench DBMS Benchmark

This benchmark is a general query benchmark for databases. 
The tests are designed around column-store databases and seem easy to 
reproduce/duplicate. The queries seem to be reasonably wide ranging.
The data is easy to get and the benchmarks are easy to understand.

The present examples show the queries and the basic setup for running 
the benchmark using PostgreSQL. We should be able to do something like 
this for our own systems, except that we will want to write the 
queries in our own languages and our own table representations. 

This benchmark would cover database performance, data analytics, and 
things like time series calculations.
