# CFAL benchmarks in the new version of Accelerate

This repository contains implementations of the [CFAL benchmarks](https://github.com/diku-dk/CFAL-bench) in the new, currently unreleased, version of Accelerate. Benchmarks nbody-naive and MG are adapted to the new version of Accelerate. A version of quickhull is available at [ivogabe/quickhull-benchmarks](https://github.com/ivogabe/quickhull-benchmarks), where we also experimented with more variants of Quickhull. In contrast to the original implementation for CFAL, which is entirely flattened, we also have partially flattened variants.
